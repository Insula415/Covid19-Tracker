if you have any criticism feel free to email fred415415@protonmail.com, any would be much appreciated!

This program took me around 10 seconds to run which is pretty slow, i tried installing libraries like
"numba" to speed up the process but it didn't work. if it is taking long to run i recommend using pypy.
$ pypy3 covid.py

INSTALLATION = 
$ git clone 
$ python3 covid.py

REQUIREMENTS = 
python3
